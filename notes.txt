Parts of web development

Front End ->
Back End ?

Client - Server (Back End) -> Logic of the application , Stores Data

Options for tech stack for backend?
Java => Hibernate, Struts, Spring, Spring Boot, JSP etc
Php => Laravel, CI (Code Igniter), Slim, Symphony etc
Ruby => ROR (Ruby on Rails) etc
Python => Django etc
GoLang => ?
C# (.net) => MVC, Entity etc
JavaScript => Express JS, Ember JS, Nest JS etc
etc

Framework vs Library
React? => Small set of methods and classes (small sized) => Library
Angular? => Huge set of methods and classes (large sized) => Frameworks

NodeJS and Express JS?
NodeJS is a runtime environment for JavaScript.
ExpressJS is a backend framework based on JavaScript.

Database DB ?
Place where all the data is stored (Textual Data)
WE NEVER STORE PHYSICAL FILES INSIDE A DATABASE LIKE DOCUMENTS, AUDIO, VIDEO ETC (Server)

Types of DB

Structed Database : SQL (Structured Query Language) / RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) => MySQL, MSSQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle etc
Unstructured Database / Non Relational Databases : MongoDB (MQL), Dynamo DB, Cassandra DB etc

Request/ Respones Cycle (Client-Server Model)
Front End => Backend (Express JS/Node JS) => Database => Backend => Front End

MERN (Mongo Express React and Node)
MEAN
Java FS Developer

Full Stack => FE (HTML, CSS, JS) + BE (PHP/JAVA/PYTHON/Express)

Mobile Dev

Android : Java based and Kotlin language
iOS : Swift

Hybrid Mobile development : 
Ionic
Cordava
React Native : 
Flutter


Steps to setup a backend application based on NodeJS
1. create a folder
2. run npm init in the folder
3. answer basic quetsions asked by npm
4. create a index.js file and write your code
5. run the file by running command node <filename> e.g node index.js

Core Modules : 
1. os
2. fs
3. events
4. http


HTTP Server
1. http module import
2. http.createServer()
3. listne(portNo)


Postman => It is a tool used to test the output of the APIs.

JS Engines

Google Chrome => v8
Mozilla Firefox => Spider Monkey
Edge => Chakra
etc


Created Server -> Listening on a port 

Sent a request => Server emits a request event => Event listerner is trigerred


API (Application Programming Interface)
Types : 

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) => Envelops of Data (XML)
REST (ReprsEntational State Transfer) => Raw data (JSON)

RESTful APIs (HTTP)
Methods of APIs

GET : Used to retreive the data from the server (E.g Get the list of products, get a list of todos etc)
POST : Used to send the data to the server in order to create a resource (E.g Submitting a form, Placing an order etc)
PUT : Used to replace the data on the server (E.g Replace a social media post)
PATCH : Used to update the record on the server (E.g Update my profile etc)
DELETE : Used to delete any record on the server (E.g Delete my account etc)
OPTIONS : Used to check if any resource is accesible to the server (Pre Flight Respone - CORS)

A request has 2 parts
Header
Body


Response
Header
Body


Static API : Which has same url and always return same set of data
Dynamic API : Which has a dynamic part in URL or in Body and sends different data when the dynamic part changes


API 
React -> Backend (Node)
Client => Server

Server => Server

Environment Variables
Set : Manual process done by a different way in different OS
Get : process.env.VARIABLE_NAME

Middleware : 


Requsest -> Middleware (app.use) -> API End point

Application Level : Applies to the whole app (app.use())
API Level : Only effects a particular end point
Module Level : Applies to all the routes of a particular module

Req and Response parts : 
Header : Meta data (Basic information of API, server name, origin details etc)
Body : Actual requested or sent data



***** INTERVIEW QUESTION****
What is MVC?

Design Pattern

MVC (Model View Controller)

Controller : Receivs a request and perorms business logic, send the response
Model : It determines the structure of the data (E.g username, dob, email)
View : Where you see the UI (React JS)

Layers : It is segregation of code.

Express router
1. import express module
2. initialize a express router new express.Router()
3. change app.get and app.post with router.get and router.post
4. connect app and router using app.use(router);
5. create a routes folder
6. create files in routes folder based on our module requirement
7. move the respective routes in their files
8. remove the common part of the route and put it in index file with app.use() in step 4
